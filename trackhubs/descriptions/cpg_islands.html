<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    CpG islands are genomic regions with a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides, 
    often associated with gene promoters and regulatory elements. This track 
    highlights CpG-rich regions across the assembly, which are frequently used 
    as markers of gene regulation and epigenetic modification.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    CpG islands were identified using the UCSC tool <code>cpg_lh</code>.
