<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    PacBio HiFi read depth.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    PacBio HiFi reads were aligned to the reference genome using minimap2
    with parameters <code>-a -x lr:hq -Y --secondary=no --eqx -L</code>.
    Alignments were filtered to retain reads with mapping quality (MQ) â‰¥ 1 and with SAM flags excluding 3840.
    Coverage tracks were generated using <a href="https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools">deepTools</a> <code>bamCoverage</code>.
