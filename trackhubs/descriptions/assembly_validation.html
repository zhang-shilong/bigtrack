<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Tracks used for assembly validation.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    PacBio HiFi reads were aligned to the assembly using 
    <a href="https://github.com/lh3/minimap2">minimap2</a> with the parameters 
    <code>-x lr:hq --secondary=no</code>. Oxford Nanopore (ONT) reads were aligned using 
    <a href="https://github.com/marbl/winnowmap">winnowmap</a> with the parameters 
    <code>-x map-ont --secondary=no</code>. Alignments were subsequently filtered with 
    <a href="https://github.com/samtools/samtools">samtools</a> to retain reads with 
    mapping quality <code>MQ &gt;= 1</code> and to remove alignments with 
    flag <code>3840</code>.
