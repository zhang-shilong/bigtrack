<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This track shows nuclear-embedded mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs) 
    detected by aligning mitochondrial sequences against the nuclear genome.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    Mitochondrial sequences were aligned to the nuclear assembly using 
    <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">BLASTN</a> with scoring parameters 
    optimized for sensitive detection. Significant alignments were filtered based on 
    sequence identity and e-value thresholds, and overlapping hits were merged to define 
    NUMT intervals.
