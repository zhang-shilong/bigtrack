<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    DNA methylation track called from Oxford Nanopore reads using Dorado.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The items are colored from <span style="color:blue;">0%</span> methylated modified (blue) to <span style="color:red;">100%</span> (red). Hovering over an item or clicking it shows the additional details found in bedMethyl. Methylation calls are shown separately for CpG sites (<b>m</b>) and non-CpG (CHG/CHH) sites (<b>h</b>).
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    DNA methylation was called with <a href="https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado">Dorado</a> 
    using a SUP model, and the calls were post-processed with 
    <a href="https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit">modkit</a> (traditional preset). 
    Only positions with Oxford Nanopore sequencing depth &ge; 5 were retained for the final track.
