<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The intervals of rDNA model.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    rDNA consensus sequences were mapped onto the assembly to identify 
    repeat intervals. Copy number was inferred from k-mer spectrumâ€“based 
    estimation, providing an approximate measure of the abundance of rDNA 
    repeats in the genome.
